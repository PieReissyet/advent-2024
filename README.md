# advent-2024

You can find a notebook with solutions for all 25 of the 2024 advent of code problems.

I tried to keep a good balance between minimizing the number of lines of code and keeping things easy to understand and fast enough.

There are some days where I enjoyed refactoring and finding prettier ways to make things work and some other like day 15 where just having something that works was enough.

Thanks a lot to Eric Wastl for the hard work. Looking forward to next year's challenge !
